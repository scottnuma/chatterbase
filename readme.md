# Chatterbase

A Slack application that lets users query a database.

Derived from the starter code provided by [BeepBoop](https://beepboophq.com/docs/article/recipe-slack-slash-command).

Chatterbase can run on Heroku's free tier. Chatterbase requires creating a Slack Application that sends HTTP requests to Chatterbase.

Slack requires HTTPS for it's /slash commands. To fulfill this requirement with local development, you can use [localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel).
